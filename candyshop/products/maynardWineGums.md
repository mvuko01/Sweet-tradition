Maynards Wine Gums are one of Britain’s most recognisable sweets. First launched by Charles Gordon Maynard in 1909, these chewy treats come in a selection of flavours including strawberry, orange and blackcurrant.

Wine gums were originally made using fermented wine – hence the name. Please note, however, that this manufacturing process is no longer used and Maynards Wine Gums do not contain any wine at all!
